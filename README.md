# Galaxy_Clustering
The goal of this project is to design a Graph Autoencoder to cluster objects described by feature vectors. In particular, data from the Euclid mission by ESA were used where every line of the dataset represents a galaxy. After applying the model on the dataset, clustering made by using a k-means algorithm results more efficient as confirmed by the Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz score.
A certain number of centers found by the algorithm correspond to actual centers.
